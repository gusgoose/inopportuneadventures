**Day 1:**

I have arrived at camp number one - _Drymen_ - which, let me tell you, is ironically named. Walk itself was largely unremarkable, apart from the incessance of the rain, which was. I met a Frenchman called Francois who speaks poor English, and we walked the whole route together. At one point he admitted discomfort due to his boxers rubbing between his legs. Guessing they were cotton, I suggested it would probably be better if he took them off entirely. He was taken aback and clearly something had been lost in translation.

**Day 2:**

A brief break in the eternity of drizzle (and worse) that may define this trip, and the march from Drymen (which did produce some) to Salochy campsite near Rowardennon was a slice of heaven. The views from the laboriously-achieved Conic hill expanded over the length of Loch Lomond, and the campsite (which is technically closed, a hard rule to police for a desolate field) is perhaps the most perfect place in Britain. I find myself here with a few other waifs and strays who, like me, considered consulting the website ahead-of-time overly officious. One of them, a German called Moritz, confided in me that he thought he was 'a bit fucked up in the head', which is the bedtime story everybody wants to hear when in the middle of nowhere. However, this somber message is tempered by the presence once again of the four Belgian chaps from Drymen, who seem comfortingly stupid and play Drake at all hours.

I saw Francois once again today, standing at the only bus-stop as I entered the town of Balmaha. He looked downcast, and told me with a perplexing air of surprise that his boots were too small. We briefly discussed contingency plans, but it was clear his mind was set on spending 6 days in Edinburgh in a Youth Hostel with a 30kg backpack and an inflamed crotch. We bid each other farewell, and passed out of each others' lives as undramatically as we had entered less than 24 hours prior.

Ayala and Daniel, the Israeli siblings who we met cowering in a barn in Drymen away from the rain, were spotted again today as they passed on the trail by my tent. Coming from Israel, and evidently being largely useless, they had not expected rain in Scotland, and so everything which had not been kept in a dry-bag was sodden... which was everything. The barn was their only salvation. Today they had intended to avoid a similar fate by arranging with somebody to ferry their bags from stop to stop. When I spoke to them today in broken English, they were still in some doubt about whether precisely this had been achieved... though they did know they were no longer in possession of their own bags. Only tomorrow will tell whether they go the same way as poor old Francois and catch the next bus from Inverarnan.

The stars are out and the waters of Loch Lomond lap against my beach, where they will hopefully stay all night.

**Day 3:**

The Belgian lads woke early two pitches down and decided the best start to the morning was to nominate one of their own to go and stand neck-deep in Loch Lomond for 15 minutes. I suspect this may be the end for them.

Spent the day walking what is generally known as the toughest section of the whole route with Moritz*, the self-professed maniac. On the whole he is not nearly as mad as first suggested, despite finishing the first two sections of the route in a single day in what he described as a 'walk of aggression'. The rain was almost constant but the route was glorious, skirting along the edge of Loch Lomond and encountering numerous vigorous waterfalls of the kind I had not known to exist in the UK.

The walk was indeed tough, and made tougher by the fact that we had added an extra 3 miles by staying in the closed, out-of-town campsite, but excellent nonetheless. 

Two miles from the day's destination we encountered a dingy bothy which we entered out of curiosity and to escape the rain. In the shadowy darkness of the inside, a downcast bunch: the Israelis, Mimi (a turkish-swedish girl I had eaten lunch with a day previous) and an English chap called Will, whose entire wardrobe consisted of fake North Face garments bought off a stall in Kathmandu (which is an odd choice for gear upon which your life, or at very least your comfort, depends). He lamented that his boots were full of water and had given him large blisters, but other than that seemed pretty unaware of where he was or why. Like Moritz, it turns out he had also made a walk of aggression, completing at least one and a half sections on his first day, from which he had to employ his whole second day recovering. This was his third, and he hadn't got far. 

Mimi was shivering and declaimed that she could not go on, and she must stay here for the night. I established from her that her tiny day bag held neither sleeping bag nor food, water, or dry clothes, and moreover that she was on an organised walking tour and had become separated from her group. All of which added up, I explained to her, to the fact that she really must continue. After some coffee brewed by the Israelis, who I can still only expect are here by accident, and a hot pad and gloves from my bag, we all ventured on through the pissing rain and declining light to Beniglass Farm, our home for the night.

A remote place, it has large fields in front for camping (in which, somewhat expectedly for the time of year, nobody was yet) and an eccentric but wholly-welcome wild-west-style bar-restaurant. We made a last minute decision, based on the impending storm warning, to forego camping this night, instead taking two 'walkers cabins' between the five of us (Mimi had rejoined her group nearby). 

Showers and Guinness, steak pie and whiskey. Some loose philosophy from Moritz. To sleep. Easyish day tomorrow, on to Tyndrum (unusually, pronounced how it is spelled).

\* A note on my meeting with Moritz: he entered camp as sun was going down after this first day's walking for him. The campsite, as already described, was technically closed, leaving all but 3 of the 200 or so large pitches completely empty. There was a very small gap between my tent and the gorse bushes that had been planted intermittently to give some shelter, in which Moritz suggested he place his tent. Not wishing to seem unwelcoming, I agreed that that was indeed possible, but that he might wish to consider broadening his horizons. He seemed a little perplexed and ended up settling for the other side of the gorse bushes. I have since learned that Moritz is a philosopher.

**Day 4:**

Through the (typically) crap, horizontal-rain of the morning a miracle was perceived. As we sat eating our breakfast in the saloon, through the mist I spotted a large backpack and the lumbering gait of a Frenchman. Lo and behold, it was Francois! I called to him and, in a fittingly undramatic manner, he joined us for breakfast and recounted his tale of redemption using a mixture of sign language, English words and noises. It seems he had spend the 24 hours since his apparent demise going all around Scotland looking for new boots. Having succeeded, he had made his own walk of aggression practically overnight, stopping briefly for a nap in the desolate bothy where Mimi almost committed Harakiri) in order to 'make lost time'. The return of Francois. He was lost, but now he is found.

When we left the restaurant after breakfast, every one of the camping fields was completely submerged. I think there has been a really rather unusual amount of rain... a hunch which, if it needed further validation, is provided it by the BBC flood warnings for Highland. Pretty good decision not to camp last night. Bodes well for the next nights.

The walk itself was a very easy 20km, hampered only by the rain, which was insistent and incessant. We are finding that we are the fastest on the trail, which is a good thing, as it's required to keep warm. The rivers are suddenly completely overflowing, and much of the path is now a stream, which makes the going more of a challenge. The trees have today given way to barren moorland and mountain, and the march ever-Northwards is feeling more and more expedition-like. Colder, wetter, higher. Have not seen the Belgians since yesterday morning... It seems they did not check into camp yesternight. At least they could have survived by eating each other for a period.

At Tyndrum, decided to stay one more night in a hut - tomorrow onwards is barren landscape and the desolation of Rannoch moor, so we shall be camping come what may. Some French comrades were trying to persuade us to book into a hut in Glencoe mountain resort tomorrow night due to the weather, but I think we are all aware that all this luxury is making us weak, and we must be forced to fight harder for our survival.

More Guinness, whiskey and fish and chips. Tomorrow is the longest stretch, the 30km to Kingshouse, where nothing at all awaits us.

**Day 5:**

Moritz, who is fortunately an optimist as well as a philosopher, summed up the whole of today: "now we are truly one with nature". I imagine that must have been about the point at which the rain started creeping into whichever orifice was the last to give way. It was a very, very wet day.

It was also the longest day - a 30km stretch across Rannoch moor, a famously beautiful and desolate place (the former quality of which was rendered obsolete, and the latter accentuated, by the literally constant pissing rain). By midday around Bridge of Orchy absolutely everything on everybody was wet through, and the myth of 'waterproof clothing' was well and truly destroyed. We stopped at Inveroroan hotel (a tiny and very antiquated place) for a sandwich and drink, but the pause only made our sodden clothes stick more to our shivering torsos. 

The second half of the walk took on a wholly more serious character than I'd encountered so far this week. I think we had all independently realised that, with no shelter so much as a tree until Glencoe (15km) and nowhere in the surrounding marshes fit to pitch a tent for miles, if anyone were to stop for longer than 30 seconds they needed to have a pretty good survival plan. Only the warmth generated from walking (fast) was keeping us from a genuinely nasty situation. Fortunately the end point eventually appeared on the horizon several hours later (Glencoe mountain resort... I I think one of the UK's only ski destinations? Ski lifts and everything) but not before we had resigned poor Will, whose pace had slowed, to almost certain death on the moor. We were all relieved when he came hobbling into our hut about 40 minutes after us, and proceeded to curse his fake North Face jacket.

The whole thing felt more like a military exercise than anything. It turns out that 'a bit hairy' translates directly into German... It was _ein bischen haarich_. 

Apart from two french chaps, and an American called Rob who, when walking, seems to be in a state of constantly half-falling-over, I reckon everybody else has bottled it. Mimi quit at Inveroroan, the Israelis decided to stay (forever?) at Beniglass farm, and the Belgians are presumably on to the second or third of their number for dinner, somewhere between Balmaha and Rowardennan. Francois is still going strong, miraculously. Will is in a bad way and expect him to expire soon. Moritz told me a story about how he once got "fully drunk" and woke up in a field in the snow without his trousers on.

Diving into a warm (and, mercifully, dry) sleeping bag and off to sleep. Tomorrow taking the Devil's Staircase to Kinlochleven. 

**Day 6:**

For the second time I have pitched my tent the wrong way round. Sparing the technical details, what this means is I am likely to wake up with my head covered in water (hopefully) or, if not my head, everything else. Perhaps it is fitting for a trip which will at least in part be defined by wetness, but the promise of poetic symmetry does little to stop me being really pissed off with myself. The three Guinness we had in Kinlochleven (officially the end of today's section) will have done nothing to avert this mistake.

Mercifully after yesterday's near-fatal cold-bath of an ordeal, the sun shone on us for much of today, on what was surely one of the most majestic sections of the entire WHW. The "Devil's Staircase" takes you up from Kingshouse to the top of the world, from which there are views over Highland proper - the main vista being over Glencoe. Then down again into Kinlochleven, which is a small, flat valley town towered over on both sides by tremendous mountains. It also happens to have, unexpectedly, what I believe is the UK's only indoor ice-climbing centre. The walking was technically quite tough, but yesterday's travails, plus the fact that this is the sixth day, rendered that largely meaningless. Everybody seems to have some sort of ailment except me, miraculously. This may be in part because the others all had very idiosyncratic starts, which I believe I have mentioned, but may also be because I have much better boots. Never skimp on boots.

After arriving in Kinlochleven, the Guinnesses, and a brief trip to the co-op during which Will perplexingly bought only a tin of kidney beans, we continued up out of the town, back on the trail to find somewhere in the hills to camp. Eventually we found a (wet but) excellent site, high up with a view over the whole valley and incredible stars. We cooked dinner in the pitch darkness of what must have been midnight (7.20pm) after which Moritz and I sat and discussed Proust at length. I have never read Proust - a fact I did a good job of covering up.

We think the Frenchmen and Rob, the lolloping American, are probably still down in town, which means of the significantly diminished bunch still on for the seven-day passage, we are currently in the lead. We'll watch them pass us as we eat

Breakfast, and probably race to the finish.

A mountain river passes by our site about 10m to the left, in a small ravine, which makes a nice sound to sleep to. Tomorrow is the final stretch, sadly.

**_Afterword_**: as I reach to scratch my bum, I realise I also have my leggings on backwards. I wonder what else.

**Day 7:**

Early on in today's proceedings, Moritz (who is a proud German and a sensitive fellow) tentatively asked the question he had clearly been pondering for many kilometres:  W_hat does my language sound like to non-natives?_ Will, who I have come to value for the simplicity of his opinions, replied "pretty camp". 

I then, regrettably, had to explain the meaning. This was, I discerned, not the answer Moritz was hoping for, and thus followed a period of elongated silence while we descended from Kinlochleven into a glorious Glen before rounding the bend to Fort William. Moritz brought this up with me twice more over the course of the next few hours, during which he had developed a strong distaste for Will. I assured him that German did not sound camp but, instead, highly aggressive, which was the best I could muster. This alternative answer did not consign me to the same fate as Will, but was clearly still not entirely satisfactory. Some minutes later, and Moritz appeared of much lighter mood - it transpired that he had run ahead to ask Francois' opinion of the matter, and had been told that, to him, it sounded much the same as English. This was good news, and put the matter to bed in Moritz's mind, regardless of what the two camp languages actually sounded like.

It was a long final stretch, 22km up and down and up again, and down again. My body has become much fitter, and now almost wholly used to carrying the 18kilo pack over whatever terrain is required. The weather was, once again, truly beautiful, and the vistas too large and wondrous to really comprehend with any single set of eyes. It was sublime, in the Burkean sense of the word (something I pretentiously pointed out to Moritz, hoping and expecting, rightly as it happened, that I could get a point here in the game of intellectual one-upmanship). 

Will, who as I have mentioned has been gradually weakening since Rowardennan due to his shoddy fake North Face gear, fell behind consistently. His miraculous powers of lone survival had been proven to us when we left him behind for the first time in the near-fatal conditions of Rannoch moor, and since then his story has been one of constant, guiltless abandonment (in the finest English tradition). He rocked up to the finish line, hobbling, about 30 minutes after us, and promptly went to buy 20 Babybels.

Several beers and food in one of Fort William's many fleshpots, with the Americans and a Swiss girl called Lisa, and a night in the shared opulence of a £36 hotel room, which will never smell the same again. 

...

But this is not the end... I somehow managed to book my flight back several days later than required, so Fort William is now my home. Tomorrow night I shall head back to camp at the base of Ben Nevis, about 30 minutes outside of town, in order to attempt an accent if the weather recommends. But not before a large breakfast, coffee relaxation, and tour of the local distillery.

My head is as dry now, upon the freshly laundered bedsheets, as it was this morning. All my other possessions are as wet, sitting limply on the makeshift clothesline between the door and the window.

**Day 8, Ben Nevis:**

I could tell how the day was to proceed from the moment that Will proclaimed he was going to "attempt the climb _bagless_". The radical plan of an intrepid adventurer, as he considered it, he proceeded to stuff a large quiche down the front of his trousers and a litre of water in the undersized pocket of his raincoat. A vast fake North Face down jacket wrapped around his shoulders partially obscured his line of sight. It became clear he did not, in fact, have a suitable bag to take up, and in this instance necessity had not been the mother of invention.

We had agreed to set off at 9.30am, so at 11.15 I and Will (who describes himself accurately as "not good at mornings") hit the trail up Ben Nevis.

Approximately 10 minutes into the walk and it was clear Will was having trouble with his quiche. I had intended to hold out for longer, but deciding I had no choice, and partially in internal penance for leaving him to certain death on the moor some days previous, I suggested (as if the idea had just struck me) that he put his extraneous effects in _my_ bag. He pondered for a second or two before agreeing that this was indeed a sensible plan of action. 5 minutes later and his jacket and bottle were also in there.

Ben Nevis is Britain's highest mountain, and really does feel like it. Despite topping out at a modest 1300 metres, it's tall enough to host multiple weather conditions at any one time. As with most mountains, there are an infinite number of ways to get up it; but the least technical, and far most popular, route is called the 'mountain track'. Originally built in the late 19th century in order to make supplying the now-defunct observatory at the summit more efficient, it is a 10-mile round-trip that anybody who is moderately fit and a bit unhinged can do in a day.

The first half of the ascent, which takes between 3 and 4 hours in total, provided glorious and far-reaching views over the Highlands. After stopping for quiche, we continued winding our way up the path until we entered cloud. 

On our return, I met Moritz by the tents. He was wide-eyed and full of uncontainable wonder at the majesty of the campsite's own 'bar and restaurant'. On the topic, I mentioned the Ben Nevis Inn we had passed by earlier and showed him a photo of the candle-lit, wooden-beamed medieval barn, it's comfortable chairs, excellent ales, live music, and log fires. "That's nice too", he said in a way that was clearly designed to placate me, before returning to his eulogy on the unlikely "campsite bar and restaurant". I became excited, if a little surprised. We agreed that we should meet in this haven for dinner and drinks, and as I marched off to the showers he reiterated urgently: "Phawwww..." (a noise I've found Germans make when they're trying to convey anything), "...it's nice. No, really... it's _very_ nice".

The shower was excellent and warm. As it happens, the Glen Nevis campsite is one of the poshest and most regularly 'award-winning' campsites in all of Europe (or so says its marketing). And in late October, just as the season was winding up, we had it almost all to ourselves. There was just one other, much older chap in the toilet block who stood and stared at me intensely, in a way that suggested he thought I couldn't see him, despite there only being two metres or so between us. Under other circumstances I might have considered this very peculiar behaviour, but after the previous week I deemed it unconcerning, and indeed thought that he might fit well into our group.

I pottered back to the tents, and met Moritz, who then excitedly led me on the proto-spiritual journey to the 'bar and restaurant'.

I looked beyond the 1970s, pine-ceiling'd, pebbledash building I'd been led to, and found nothing else there. The belief I'd been cultivating regarding the cultural closeness and shared artistic heritage of the Germans and English expired immediately. As we entered the bar area, with it's loudly-tartaned floors and upholstery, wipe-clean birch-effect tables and glass cabinets full of faux-old trinkets, I had the sense of being in a Nevada motel. Or possibly the lobby of an overnight passenger ferry (one of those ones which is filled largely with lorry drivers). We sat.

Stil mentally preoccupied with the fascinating culture-gap I had clearly discovered between the Germans and what I assumed were all other sane people, I exchanged the typical pleasantries with Moritz. He was sitting on the tartan bench with his arms spread wide atop the backrest, surveying his surroundings with rapt pleasure. He had a look of great, deep satisfaction, the occasional nod of his head signifying that he'd spotted an artex feature that was new to him, or a piece of wood-effect laminate he found particularly pleasing.

I asked him about his day as we sat with a pint of local ale. So enraptured was he, It turned out, with this bar/restaurant, he'd spent almost all day writing about it. His writings were "about this special place" he solemnly explained to me, "and my interactions with it." I wondered with some horror what those interactions might have been, and whether this could be some sort of post-traumatic response to the day on Rannoch moor, but decided not to delve further... a move I still consider one of my best.

I had a burger, which was very average (though I didn't dare tell Moritz). I realised I had once again forgotten to put my energy gels in my mouth during this afternoon's pursuits, which was the last activity of the trip that could truly warrant them.

After eating we started chatting to a girl called Anne who was sat at the table opposite ours, and we all got whisky. Anne was from Germany, and Moritz took great pleasure in expressing to her how much he disliked Germans. One whisky turned into three, as we all tried uselessly to postpone the sleep that really did signal the end of the trip.

Moritz and I stood by the tents in the darkness and surveyed the stars. The looming outline of Ben Nevis was faintly discernible about 500 metres away. It was getting colder - maybe 5 degrees. We spent 10 minutes putting the world to rights before heading to sleep.

**Day 9, Addendum:**

I woke up with everything wet and decided that when I got home I would sell my tent.

Back in Glasgow I spent a happy three hours sitting and drinking beer, waiting for the time to pass until my train. I mainly researched which tent I should buy next (an exciting prospect for outdoorsy people and everyone else who finds themselves devoid of friends or a life), talking only at the end of my sojourn with a guy and girl sat on the next-door table. She told me proudly that she had four tents ("one for clothing, one for food, one for sleeping and one for gathering, when at festivals"), and he told me about a time he had pulled an EastEnders actress while on holiday on Magaluf. In exchange, I explained an arcane episode from my past in which I became enemy-number-one of a now-obscure indie rock band). We were all suitably impressed with one another. Back to civilisation.
